# Paste Link Into Macro

Allows you to paste item links and profession links into the macro text.

## How to use

For item links just shift-click an item as usual.
For profession links there is a new entry in the dropdown for creating a link to your profession that allows you to insert the profession link into the macro text.

## Features

* **Pasting item links from the professions GUI, crafting orders GUI and bags GUI into a macro text.**
  This allows you to create macros that send chat messages which refer to items via link.
  Without the add-on shift-clicking an item only inserts the name of the item into the macro text.
  With the add-on an item link is inserted instead.
* **Pasting profession links from the professions GUI into a macro text.**
  This allows you to create macros that send chat messages which refer to your profession via link.
  This add-on makes it more straight forward to insert a profession link into your macro text.
  You can do it by opening the profession window of your profession, clicking the button for creating a link to your profession and then click on the dropdown option "Macro" at the bottom of the dropdown.
